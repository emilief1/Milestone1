      <h3> The History of Web Browers </h3> 
      <p>
        Web browsers are a lot newer than most people probably think they are.  A scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee was the first person
         to make a web browser. Berners-Lee was able to create a user-friendly interface in 1990; he named it the “WorldWideWeb”. Once people 
         started to get comfortable with the use of a web browser, more people wanted to take their chances by making something similar. At the 
         University of Illinois, the National Centre for Supercomputing Applications created what was called “Mosaic”, which became very popular 
         because it allowed the use of images on the web. “Mosaic” came into exitance in 1993 and by 1994 a new browser called “Netscape” became 
         available by Andreessen. By 1995 Microsoft jumped into the fray of making browsers. Microsoft released “Internet Explorer”, with the development 
         of the Microsoft browser it started what was called browser wars. It was basically a fight and or race to see who could develop a better, faster 
         and more enticing looking web browser. Opera software released a web Browers called Opera and then in 1998 Netscape created “Mozilla” by making 
         its code open source which later developed into Mozilla Firefox. Firefox has been a very popular browser for a very long time. There was not a 
         major development for a few years, and the next one to come out was in 2003. Apple released “Safari” which was made for Macintosh operating 
         system but soon was adapted to windows users and then to mobiles as well. The next big web browser to be launched was in 2008 and it was 
         “Google Chrome”.  Google Chrome was a massive hit because it upgraded web development, worked at a high speed, and was a more enticing site to use. 
         In 2015 “Microsoft Edge” was released and upgraded from its original format under the name “Internet Explorer”. The browsers like “Google Chrome”, 
         “Mosaic”, and “WorldWideWeb” and some others are the ones that impacted browser history the most, there are a bunch more that are not talked about 
         a lot that are still important to the development of the browser.

      <h3> What Are The Most Popular Web Browsers Now? </h3>
      <p>
         The most popular web browsers currently are chrome, safari and Microsoft edge. According to the Backlinko team, they state, “Chrome remains the #1 
         most-used browser on mobile and desktop. Safari, largely thanks to being the default browser on iOS devices, comes in at a relatively close second” 
         (Backlinko). Edge is used the most on desktop compared to IOS devices. Other browsers like Firefox and Opera are being used by people they are just 
         not as popular as others.<br>
         During the creation of web browsers, there was a fight between developers. This is referred to as “The Browser Wars” and this occurred in 1995. 
         Netscape and Microsoft worked endlessly to outdo each other. This war started because Microsoft licensed the other Mosaic code and then built off of it.
        After going back and forth Microsoft cornered most of the market until Netscape came out with an open source, not for profit Mozilla. Later more bowsers 
        enter the market and the war died out.  <br>
        The future of browsers will only get better. Pages will load faster; there will be more privacy protection, and more features as well. There will likely 
        be more open-source code which was used by google and will be used more often. The are so many possibilities in the future when it comes to web browsers.
